## Overview
Updated the size predictor application to work specifically with hooded jacket measurements based on the provided size charts. The application now uses the new measurement system with chest 1/2, waist 1/2, bottom 1/2, shoulder length, and total length measurements in centimeters.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Updates (`public/index.html`)
- **Updated measurement fields**: All measurements now in centimeters
- **New measurement fields**:
  - Chest 1/2 (cm) - range: 40-80cm
  - Waist 1/2 (cm) - range: 35-75cm  
  - Bottom 1/2 (cm) - range: 40-80cm
  - Shoulder Length (cm) - range: 10-25cm
  - Total Length (cm) - range: 60-90cm
- **Updated display section**: Shows all five new measurements in the results

### 2. JavaScript Updates (`public/script.js`)
- **Added hooded jacket size chart data**: Implemented the exact measurements from the provided charts
- **New prediction function**: `predictHoodedJacketSize()` with weighted algorithm
- **Updated form handling**: Processes all measurement fields
- **Enhanced display logic**: Shows all measurements in centimeters

### 3. Server Updates (`server.js`)
- **Updated size chart data**: Matches the provided hooded jacket charts exactly
- **New prediction algorithm**: Handles chest/waist/bottom and length/shoulder measurements separately
- **Enhanced estimation**: Provides better estimates when detailed measurements aren't provided
- **Improved confidence calculation**: Higher confidence for more complete measurements

## Size Chart Data

## Prediction Algorithm

### Primary Measurements (80% weight)
- **Chest 1/2**: 35% weight
- **Waist 1/2**: 35% weight
- **Bottom 1/2**: 30% weight

### Secondary Measurements (20% weight)
- **Total Length + Shoulder Length**: Combined 20% weight

### Body Type Adjustments
- **Slim**: Size down by one level
- **Athletic**: Size up by one level  
- **Plus**: Size up by one level
- **Average**: No adjustment

## Features

### 1. Accurate Size Prediction
- Uses exact measurements from the provided hooded jacket charts
- Weighted algorithm for optimal matching
- Body type adjustments for better fit

### 2. Measurement Estimation
- Estimates measurements when not provided
- Based on height, weight, and body type
- Lower confidence for estimated measurements

### 3. Confidence Scoring
- Higher confidence for complete measurements (up to 30% bonus for all 5 measurements)
- Bonus confidence for length matches
- Adjustments based on data quality

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- Clear measurement labels in centimeters
- Helpful placeholders with example values
- Comprehensive results display

## Testing

A test file (`test_hooded_jacket.html`) has been created to verify the functionality with various test cases:
- Exact size matches
- Different body types
- Estimated measurements
- Edge cases

## Usage

1. Select "Hooded Jacket 3" as garment type
2. Fill in basic information (height, weight, body type)
3. Optionally provide detailed measurements:
   - Chest 1/2 (cm)
   - Waist 1/2 (cm)
   - Bottom 1/2 (cm)
   - Shoulder Length (cm)
   - Total Length (cm)
4. Submit to get size prediction with confidence level

## Technical Notes

- All measurements are in centimeters
- The algorithm prioritizes chest, waist, and bottom measurements
- Length measurements provide additional accuracy
- Body type adjustments ensure better fit recommendations
- The system works with both provided and estimated measurements
- Hooded jackets have consistent measurements across all sizes (one-size-fits-all approach)
- The system accounts for body type variations even with consistent chart measurements
